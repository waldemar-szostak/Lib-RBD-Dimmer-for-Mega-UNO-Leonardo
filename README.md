The following library is used for work with dimmer, it gives ability to control large ammoun of dimmer by the means of hardware timer and external interrupt through previously defined pin:
<br>For Leonardo, zero-cross used pin D7 
<br>For other boards used second pin

This library can simplify user code with following functions:

    1. Function  dimmerLamp - this function initializes the number of operating pin and is defined by the user
    Example: dimmerLamp dimmer4(4);   dimmer output DIM/PSM is initialized on the pin 4
     
    2. Function begin port initialization, timer and external interrupt from zero-cross.
        Initialization of zero-cross is set in the library and corresponds to pin D2 on the board
        (controllers Duemilanove, Uno, Nano, Pro mini, Leonardo, Mega)
    Example: dimmer4.begin(NORMAL_MODE, ON/OFF); port initialization, work mode choice, ON/OFF. 
    Parameter 1: dimmer working modes consist of two choices - NORMAL_MODE and TOGGLE_MODE 

        a. NORMAL_MODE to make dimmer work in defined value from 0 to 100 (%) (integer)
            Example of this mode located in \RBDdimmer\examples\SimpleDimmer
        b. TOGGLE_MODE smooth change of dimming value up or down in a defined range. This solutions implies change of dimming values by means of hardware timer, without using the cycle code.
            Example of this mode located in \RBDdimmer\examples\SimpleToggleDimmer

    Parameter 2: ON/OFF.
        a. ON - turns timer ON, allows to use dimmer.
        b. OFF - turns timer parameters OFF, prevents the use of dimmer.


    3. Function setPower sets dimming value from 0 to 100%
        Example: dimmer4.setPower(90);

    4. Function getPower to display current dimming value
        Example: Serial.print(dimmer4.getPower()); Result 0~100 int
   
    5. Function setMode sets and changes the work mode (NORMAL_MODE and TOGGLE_MODE)
                dimmer4.setMode(NORMAL_MODE/TOGGLE_MODE)

    6. Function getMode displays values of current work mode
        Example: Serial.print(dimmer4.getPower());  Result 0 (NORMAL_MODE) or 1 (TOGGLE_MODE)
   
    7. Function setState sets dimming state ON/OFF
        Example: dimmer4.setState(ON); delay(100); dimmer4.setState(OFF);
   
    8. Function getState displays current state of dimmer
        Serial.print(dimmer4.getState()); Result 0 (OFF) or 1 (ON)
   
    9. Function changeState changes dimmer state to the opposite one 
        Пример dimmer4.setState(ON); delay(100); dimmer4.changeState; delay(100);
  
    10. Function toggleSettings smooth change of dimming value up or down in a defined range
        Example located in \RBDdimmer\examples\SimpleToggleDimmer
